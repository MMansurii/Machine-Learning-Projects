# Machine Learning Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects Collection**, where I explore various real-world problems and datasets using diverse machine learning algorithms and techniques. Each project demonstrates a structured approach to data preprocessing, model building, and result analysis.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into individual project folders. Each folder contains:
- The dataset used (or a link to access it).
- The machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- Insights and key takeaways from the project.
